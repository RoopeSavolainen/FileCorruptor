## FileCorruptor

# Summary
This program corrupts files.
You can get the basic usage guide by using the '-h' flag.

# Installation
No dependencies apart from the standard C++ libs (minimum standard is C++0x).
Just build with whatever compiler you like best. The program ships with a Makefile. After compilation move the binary to your PATH.

# Usage
The program takes the following parameters:
-f, --input_file:
	The file to be corrupted. This is the only required parameter.
-o, --output_file:
	The output file to write the corrupted file to. If not given, will overwrite the original file.
-s, --strength:
	The chance of a byte getting corrupted. Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Defaults to 0.1.
-b, --begin:
	Skips the first N bytes of a file when corrupting and only copies them.
-e, --end:
	Same as above, but skips the last N bytes.
-v, --verbose:
	Prints additional information.
